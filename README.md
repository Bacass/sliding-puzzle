# 8-Puzzle (Sliding Puzzle)
***--- THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS ---***

**8-Puzzle** is a **sliding puzzle game** that features a walkthrough of the optimal solution and allows users to customize the tiles using photos selected from their Gallery. In finding the optimal path from the current puzzle state to the goal state, the system employs the informed search algorithm A* and uses Manhattan distance as an admissible and consistent heuristic to estimate the cost. 

*Inspired by the process management exercise in our Mobile Development class, I started creating this app during our university break, after finishing my second year of undergraduate studies. As one of my first personal projects, working on this served as an opportunity to synthesize concepts and practices that I have learned from our second-year courses, such as:*
- *Exploration of language features (from Advanced Programming and Theory of Programming Languages)*
- *Program optimization (from Algorithms and Complexity)*
- *Artificial intelligence and search algorithms (from Introduction to Intelligent Systems)*
- *Quality assurance and unit testing (from Introduction to Software Engineering)*

The **source code documentation** can be accessed through the following website: [https://memgonzales.github.io/sliding-puzzle/](https://memgonzales.github.io/sliding-puzzle/).
